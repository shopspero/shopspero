          1. The Bible is Inspired by God & Without Error
        </Heading>
        <Text>
          All Scripture is self-attesting and, being truth, requires the human
          mind wholeheartedly to subject itself in all its activities to the
          authority of Scripture complete as the Word of God, standing written
          in the sixty-six books of the Holy Bible, all therein being verbally
          inspired by Almighty God and therefore without error.

          2. There is One True God
        </Heading>
        <Text>
          We believe that there is but one only, the living and true God, and
          that there are three persons in the Godhead, the Father, the Son and
          the Holy Ghost; and that these three are one and the same in
          substance, equal in power and glory.

          3. The Lord Jesus Christ is Fully God & Fully Human
        </Heading>
        <Text>
          The Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, has always existed. He too is
          without beginning or end (Revelation 1:8). In order to complete His
          earthly sacrificial mission, He became human by being born of a
          virgin, conceived by the Holy Spirit (Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:31, 35). He
          lived a perfect life, absolutely without sin (Hebrews 7:26; 1 Peter
          2:22). While on earth He worked many miracles through the anointing of
          the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:22, 10:38). In order to restore fallen
          mankind, He died on the cross as a substitute for the sins of every
          person (1 Corinthians 15:3, 2 Corinthians 5:21). He was raised from
          the dead by the supernatural power of God (Matthew 28:6; Luke 24:38, 1
          Corinthians 6:14, 15:4). Since His resurrection He has been exalted,
          and is seated at the right hand of God (Acts 1:9, 11, 2:33;
          Philippians 2:9-11; Hebrews 1:3).

          4. The Fall of Humankind in Sin
        </Heading>
        <Text>
          “Just as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through
          sin, and so sin spread through all men” (Romans 5:12). One of the
          immediate effects of the Fall was that mankind was separated from God.
          In the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve had perfect communion and
          fellowship with God. When they rebelled against Him, that fellowship
          was broken. Because of the Fall, death became a reality, and all
          creation was subject to it. “For the wages of sin is death, but the
          free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Romans
          6:23)

          5. The Salvation of Humankind in Christ
        </Heading>
        <Text>
          God made a way through His Son, Jesus Christ. Romans 5:8 says, “But
          God demonstrates His own love for us in that while we were still
          sinners Christ died for us!” You receive this gift of salvation by
          faith alone. Ephesians 2:8 says, “For by grace you are saved, through
          faith, and this not from yourselves; it is God's gift-not from works,
          so that no one can boast.” Jesus Christ died in our place when He was
          crucified on the cross. We deserved to be the ones placed on that
          cross to die because we are the ones who live sinful lives. But Christ
          took the punishment on Himself in our place—He substituted Himself for
          us and took what we rightly deserved. “God made him who had no sin to
          be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of
          God” (2 Corinthians 5:21).

          6. The Role of the Holy Spirit
        </Heading>
        <Text>
          The Holy Spirit is the seal of man's salvation (John 14:26-27; Eph.
          1:13). He teaches us (John 16:13) and brings revelation to us (John
          14:26; Rom. 8:26-27). He also works out sanctification in our lives by
          God's Word, helping us become more like Jesus (Eph. 5:26; 1 Pet. 1:2);
          and gives spiritual gifts to us so that we might represent God's
          kingdom to the fullest within our communities (Acts 2:1-21; 1 Cor.
          12:4-11; Acts 4:27-31; Heb. 2:2-4; Eph. 4:7-16; 1 Pet. 4:10-11).

          7. The Blessed Hope of Christ's Return
        </Heading>
        <Text>
          Titus 2:12-13 teaches us “to live self-controlled, upright and godly
          lives in this present age, while we wait for the blessed hope—the
          appearance of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.” We
          will be blessed beyond measure when we see Christ. The trials of this
          life will be over, and we will see that “our present sufferings are
          not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us”
          (Romans 8:18). The bodies of those who have died will be raised to be
          joined with their souls, and then the bodies of those believers still
          living on earth will be changed into a body like the Lord's
          resurrection body.
