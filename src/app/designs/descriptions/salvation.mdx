> <sup>9</sup>Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. \
> <sup>10</sup>For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life. \

There is much abstract Christian jargon that is not clearly defined, one of them being &ldquo;salvation.&rdquo; We wanted to clearly and biblically define &ldquo;salvation&rdquo; because it is a fundamental component of the Gospel. Here, we define it with a phrase we collectively agreed upon (being delivered from Godâ€™s wrath through Jesus and His life, sacrificial death, and resurrection) and back it up with Scripture.
