The Redeemed Hoodie reminds us of God&apos;s mercy and grace in redeeming us sinners. On the back, the illustration depicts rays of sunlight shining over a valley that was once dark. This symbolizes how God redeemed us when we were walking in darkness; like the rising sun He comes to us to guide our feet to the path of peace.
