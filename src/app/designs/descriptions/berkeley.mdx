> For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many. \

As Jesus Christ humbly came to serve us, sinners, by giving His life for us to be saved, we, Christians, have the same goal of serving others. Through Spero, we hope to serve the underserved and ones in need, but also our peers and people of Berkeley.
