      '"justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that \n' +
      'is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, \n' +
      'to be received by faith. This was to show God\'s righteousness, because \n' +
      'in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It was to show \n' +
      'his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the \n' +
      'justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus."; The hoodie reminds us of \n' +
      'God\'s grace and how we have been justified at the cost of the precious \n' +
      'blood of Jesus Christ.',
