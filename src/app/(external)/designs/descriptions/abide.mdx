> He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide \
> in the shadow of the Almighty. \
> I will say to the Lord, &ldquo;My refuge and my fortress, \
> my God, in whom I trust.&rdquo; \
> &mdash;Psalm 91:1-2

The Abide Hoodie was made to remind us of how God is our fortress we can abide in. The silhouette of a roof symbolizes the shelter and refuge our God is, while the shadow of the house represents the shadow of the Almighty.
