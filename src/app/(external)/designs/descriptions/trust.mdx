> <sup>25</sup>For this reason I say to you, do not be worried about your life, as to what you will eat or what you will drink; nor for your body, as to what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? \
> <sup>26</sup>Look at the birds of the air, that they do not sow, nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth much more than they? \
> <sup>27</sup>And which of you by worrying can add a single cubit to his life span? \
> <sup>28</sup>And why are you worried about clothing? Observe how the lilies of the field grow; they do not toil nor do they spin, \
> <sup>29</sup>yet I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these. \
> <sup>30</sup>But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, will He not much more clothe you? You of little faith! \
> <sup>31</sup>Do not worry then, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear for clothing?’ \
> <sup>32</sup>For all these things the Gentiles eagerly seek; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. \
> <sup>33</sup>But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. \
