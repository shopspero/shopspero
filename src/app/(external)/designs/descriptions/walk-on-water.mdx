> <sup>29</sup>And he said, Come. And when Peter came down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. \
> <sup>30</sup>But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. \
> <sup>31</sup>And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? \
> &mdash;Matthew 14:29-31

Our Walk on Water sticker was inspired by Matthew 14:29, a verse that reminds us that, however impossible something demanded by Christ may seem, He will grant power to us if we receive His word by faith. Whatever form the &lsquo;water&rsquo; takes in our own lives, this verse and this sticker reminds us that we are upheld by His power only, and we can overcome any obstacle as long as we remain steadfast in our faith.
