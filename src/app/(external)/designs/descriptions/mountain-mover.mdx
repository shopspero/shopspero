> He replied, &ldquo;Because you have so little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, &lsquo;Move from here to there,&rsquo; and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.&rdquo; \
> &mdash;Matthew 17:20-21

Our Mountain Mover sticker was inspired by Matthew 17:20, with the goal of representing how our faith is ever-thriving and ever-increasing. Our initial introduction to the concept of faith is often small, daunting, and unfamiliar. However, this verse reminds us of how a faith that starts out as an unfamiliar idea can transform into something capable of moving mountains.
