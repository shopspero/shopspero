The Justified Hoodie was inspired by Romans 3:24-26 which says "justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus." The hoodie reminds us of Godâ€™s grace and how we have been justified at the cost of the precious blood of Jesus Christ.
