 Justification is something that God bestows as a gift which can never be earned or deserved. God sent forth his only begotten son to be the propitiation of his wrath Jesus has paid the ransom for us. Not only is the sinner’s guilt transferred to Christ, but in God’s sight, his merit is given to the sinner. After the transfer takes place, God looks at the sinner and declares him to be justified. Not because he has been cleared of his sin, but because he has been redeemed from his sin. When God spares me and gives me the gift of his kingdom and access into heaven, he does not compromise his own integrity to do it. His righteousness is preserved and maintained throughout.
